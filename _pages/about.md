This project is thankful to the work of several volunteers and academics ranging from Johns Hopkins University to Covid19india.org. 

This consists of all the work done by [@meghanabhange](https://github.com/meghanabhange/) and @NirantK which is fit for public consumption by their personal opinion.

This typically includes estimations, reviews and data visualisation to explore datasets.
