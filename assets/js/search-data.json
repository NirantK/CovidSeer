            "title": "Are Millions of Indians at Risk?",
            "content": "5/ The estimates for the best case testing scenario, where we ramp up to 30K tests per day at 30% every 3 days are also pretty damn depressing. In a country of 1 Billion, millions of people *can* (NOT will) go diagnosed.Here is what the Actual vs Detected Curve looks like pic.twitter.com/EXDx9QRlPF . &mdash; Nirant (@NirantK) April 9, 2020 Yesterday, I made a bit preposterous claim when I shared that upto 1 Million Indians might be at Infection Risk, or might even be infected in India by 2nd week of April. . This is ~0.1% of India&#39;s population . Now, ICMR [1] confirmed that upto 1.8% Indians with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) might be infected. . This is a weak validation for what I assume. Since I assume ~0.1% of the population to be infected, a ~2% incidence of Covid19 in SARI patients appears to be in trend line of what we would expect. . More important, this is actual data saying that reality might be better than my models. . Let&#39;s assume only x% of Indians suffer from SARI, then only ~2% of that x% = 0.02x are symptomatic because of Covid. . This lowers our symptomatic population which will require Covid specific medical care by 50x! . Here is what I want you to know . 2 out of 100 patients tested positive. Exact: 104 of the 5911 patients they tested, were positive. | . | 1 out of 2 patients did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel. Exact: 40 out of 104 patients | . | 2 out of 100 men and 1 out 100 women tested positive. Exact: 85 men out of 3676 men tested positive. 17 out of 2047 women tested positive. | . | FAQ . Q. How many tests were done in all? 5911, out of which 104 tested positive. . Q. Where these tests done? They were done across 20 States and Union Territories in India. . Q. Which were the highest prevalence rate states? Tripura (11.1%), Chandigarh (4.2%), Telengana (4.2%), Maharashtra (3.8%), West Bengal (3.5%) . Q. What was the prevalance rate in known hotspots? Kerala (0.2%), Rajasthan (0%), Tamil Nadu (0.9%) . Q. What was the age distribution of tests and cases? A. See table here: . Age groups (yr) Number of Case (% Positive) Number of SARI Patients Percent Positivity . 0‑9 | 2 (2.0) | 386 (6.8) | 0.5 | . 10‑19 | 0 (0.0) | 371 (6.5) | 0.0 | . 20‑29 | 9 (8.8) 14 | 19 (25.0) | 0.6 | . 30‑39 | 8 (7.8) 9 | 71 (17.1) | 0.8 | . 40‑49 | 16 (15.7) 6 | 34 (11.2) | 2.5 | . 50‑59 | 31 (30.4) 6 | 37 (11.2) | 4.9 | . 60‑69 | 26 (25.5) 6 | 72 (11.8) | 3.9 | . 70‑79 | 8 (7.8) | 405 (7.1) | 2.0 | . ≥80 | 2 (2.0) | 187 (3.3) | 1.1 | . Q. What does SARI mean? Severe Acute Respiratory Illness . Q. What does this tell us? For now, it tells us that upto 1% of India&#39;s population which has SARI has SARI because of Covid19 caused by Coronavirus / CCP Virus. . This study&#39;s sample size of ~6K SARI Patients is a loose approximation. This obviously is not a satisfactory sample of the 1 Billion+ Indians, yet I think this is the best and most reliable data I&#39;ve seen on this topic so far. . I&#39;m also happy with their testing distribution which they&#39;ve shared in detail. .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
